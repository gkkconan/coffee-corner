            Our story was originally born in a small urban center,
            among small alleys and skyscrapers, in the heart of the city.
            It all began as a coffee enthusiast from a young age,
            James felt the call of coffee and its immensurable aroma.
            His curiosity to discover the secrets behind each cup led him
            to travel the world, peering into distant lands and
            ancient traditions for the key to the perfect coffee." />
