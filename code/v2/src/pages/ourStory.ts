            <h1> Our Story </h1>
            <p>
                Our story was originally born in a small urban center, among
                small alleys and skyscrapers, in the heart of the city.
                It all began as a coffee enthusiast from a young age, James felt
                the call of coffee and its immensurable aroma. His curiosity to
                discover the secrets behind each cup led him to travel the world,
                peering into distant lands and ancient traditions for the key to the
                perfect coffee.

        <h1> A story throught generations </h1>
        <p>
            James' passion was passed down from generation to generation,
            taking root in the heart of the family and guiding it along a path
            of experimentation and refinement. Each family member left a small
            mark on the business, enriching it with new discoveries and innovations.
            Through time, our family has refined production techniques and carefully
            selected beans from the most remote regions of the world, exploring
            every corner of the globe in search of the most delicious and authentic coffee.
